1. ./varifyDate.cpp => Write a C++ application that read a date as integer and extracts a day,
month and year and determine whether the date is valid. If the program is
given a valid date, an appropriate message is displayed. If instead the
program is given an invalid date, an explanatory message is given.
To recognize whether the date is valid, you must be able to determine whether 
the year is a leap year or not. If the given year is leaping year, 
then program prints the next 20 leap years otherwise a message that says 
"A valid date but not a Leap Year". Your program should also consider that century
year cannot be leap year unless it is divisible by 400. See the example below for
the expected input/output behavior for a valid date.
2. ./ticketSell.cpp => Kokebe Tsibah secondary and preparatory prepare school closing function (gathering)
and invite various concerned body. The people who attend the school function categorized 
in to four groups and given a code. Accordingly, 1 represents an infant,
2 represents a child, 3 represents a teenager, and 4 represents an adult.
No other integer value should be accepted as valid input,
and data entry should stop when a negative value is entered. Write an application that read
entrance ticket number, person code as 1, 2, 3 or 4, and entrance fee. The fee schedule is
5ETB for child, 10ETB infant, and 20ETB for teenager and adults. The program should compute 
and display total numbers of people attend the function and total amount of ticket sales.
Also the program should display a list of how many infants, children, teenagers, and adults
were at the school function along with category codes. You should write the program without using array.
3. ./Shape.cpp make c++code draw a shape
